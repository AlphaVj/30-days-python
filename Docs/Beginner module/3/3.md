### [What is Operators, Operands and Operations](#03---operators)
In programming, an operator is a symbol or keyword that represents a specific operation or action to be performed on one or more operands. Operators are fundamental to the syntax and semantics of programming languages, and they are used to manipulate data and perform various calculations or transformations in a program.



**Operands:**

Operands are the values or variables on which operators perform their operations.
For example, in the expression 3 + 5, 3 and 5 are operands, and the + operator performs the addition operation on them.
Types of Operators:

**Programming languages provide a wide range of operators, including:**

* Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations (e.g., +, -, *, /).
* Comparison Operators: Used for comparing values (e.g., ==, !=, <, >).
* Logical Operators: Used for combining and evaluating logical conditions (e.g., and, or, not).
* Assignment Operators: Used for assigning values to variables (e.g., =).
* Bitwise Operators: Used for manipulating individual bits in binary data (e.g., &, |, <<, >>).
* Ternary Conditional Operator: Used for conditional expressions (e.g., x if condition else y).
And more...

**Operations:**

Each operator performs a specific operation or action on its operands.
For example, the + operator performs addition, the > operator performs greater-than comparison, and the and operator combines logical conditions.

**Expression:**

An expression is a combination of operators and operands that represents a computation to produce a value.
For example, 3 + 5 is an expression that evaluates to 8.

**Order of Operations (Precedence):**

Operators may have different levels of precedence, which determine the order in which they are evaluated within an expression.
For example, in 3 + 5 * 2, the multiplication (*) operator has higher precedence than addition (+), so it's evaluated first.

**Side Effects:**

Some operators may have side effects, which means they modify the state of variables or objects.
For example, the += assignment operator not only performs addition but also assigns the result back to a variable, modifying its value.

**Overloading:**

Some programming languages, including Python, allow operator overloading. This means that custom behavior can be defined for operators when used with user-defined classes or types.
Operators are essential for performing a wide range of tasks in programming, from basic arithmetic calculations to complex logical conditions. Understanding the behavior and precedence of operators is crucial for writing correct and efficient code.





> **Operators in Python are symbols or keywords that perform various operations on variables or values. They are an essential part of programming and are used for tasks like arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical operations, and more.**

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

### Types of Python Operators
1. Arithmetic operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Special Operators

## [Arithmetic Operators](#03---operators)
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

![arithmetic operators](/images/arithmetic%20operator.png)

```py
a = 5
b = 2

# addition
print ('Sum: ', a + b)  

# subtraction
print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# multiplication
print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# division
print ('Division: ', a / b) 

# floor division
print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# modulo
print ('Modulo(remainder): ', a % b)  

# a to the power b
print ('Power: ', a ** b) 
```
**Output:**
```py
Sum: 7
Subtraction: 3
Multiplication: 10
Division: 2.5
Floor Division: 2
Modulo(remainder): 1
Power: 25
```
## [Assignment Operators](#03---operators)

The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. The most commonly used assignment operator is the equal sign (=). It assigns the value on the right-hand side of the equal sign to the variable on the left-hand side

Python also provides some compound assignment operators, which combine an arithmetic operation with assignment. These operators are a shorthand way of performing an operation and then assigning the result to a variable.

![assignment](/images/assignment%20operators.jpg)

```py 
'Simple Assignment (=):'
x = 10  # Assigns the value 10 to the variable x
print('Simple Assignment (=): ', x)

'Addition Assignment (+=):'
x = 5
x += 3  # Equivalent to x = x + 3
# Now x is 8
print('Addition Assignment (+=): ', x)

'Subtraction Assignment (-=):'
x = 10
x -= 4  # Equivalent to x = x - 4
# Now x is 6
print('Subtraction Assignment (-=): ', x)

'Multiplication Assignment (*=):'
x = 7
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
# Now x is 14
print('Multiplication Assignment (*=): ', x)

'Division Assignment (/=):'
x = 16
x /= 4  # Equivalent to x = x / 4
# Now x is 4.0
print('Division Assignment (/=): ', x)

'Floor Division Assignment (//=):'
x = 15
x //= 4  # Equivalent to x = x // 4
# Now x is 3
print('Floor Division Assignment (//=): ', x)

'Modulus Assignment (%=):'
x = 11
x %= 3  # Equivalent to x = x % 3
# Now x is 2
print('Modulus Assignment (%=): ', x)

'Exponentiation Assignment (**=):'
x = 2
x **= 3  # Equivalent to x = x ** 3
# Now x is 8
print('Exponentiation Assignment (**=) ', x)
```
**Output:**
```py
Simple Assignment (=): 10
Addition Assignment (+=): 8
Subtraction Assignment (-=): 6
Multiplication Assignment (*=): 14
Division Assignment (/=): 4.0
Floor Division Assignment (//=): 3
Modulus Assignment (%=): 2
Exponentiation Assignment (* *=): 8
```
## [Comparison Operators](#03---operators)
Comparison operators in Python are used to compare two values or expressions and return a Boolean result (either True or False) based on the comparison. They are often used in conditional statements and loops to make decisions based on the relationships between values.

![comparison](/images/comparison%20operators.jpg)

```py
a = 5

b = 2

# equal to operator
print('a == b =', a == b)

# not equal to operator
print('a != b =', a != b)

# greater than operator
print('a > b =', a > b)

# less than operator
print('a < b =', a < b)

# greater than or equal to operator
print('a >= b =', a >= b)

# less than or equal to operator
print('a <= b =', a <= b)
```
**Ouutput:**
```py
a == b = False
a != b = True
a > b = True
a < b = False
a >= b = True
a <= b = False
```
> **Note: Comparison operators are used in decision-making and loops. We'll see more about the comparison operator and decision-making in later on topics**
## [Logical Operators](#03---operators#03---operators)
Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values (True or False) or expressions. These operators allow you to combine and manipulate Boolean values to make decisions and control the flow of your program. Python provides three main logical operators: and, or, and not. 

![logical](/images/logical_operators.png)

```py
# logical AND
print(True and True)     # True
print(True and False)    # False

# logical OR
print(True or False)     # True

# logical NOT
print(not True)          # False
```
**Logical Operators have the Truth Table**

The below table shows that how the possibility of A,B results with the Logical operators 

![truth table](/images/logical%20operator-truth%20table.jpg)
> **Note: These logical operations are used in conditional statements**
## [Bitwise Operators](#03---operators#03---operators)
In Python, bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of integers. 

Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit, hence the name.

**For example**, 2 is 10 in binary and 7 is 111.

Python supports the following bitwise operators:

![bitwise](/images/bitwise-operator.png)

**Bitwise AND (&):**

Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits.
Sets a bit to 1 if and only if both bits in the compared positions are 1.
```py
x = 5   # Binary: 101
y = 3   # Binary: 011
result = x & y  # Binary: 001 (Decimal: 1)
```

**Bitwise OR (|):**

Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits.
Sets a bit to 1 if at least one of the bits in the compared positions is 1.
```py
x = 5   # Binary: 101
y = 3   # Binary: 011
result = x | y  # Binary: 111 (Decimal: 7)
```

**Bitwise XOR (^):*8

Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits.
Sets a bit to 1 if exactly one of the bits in the compared positions is 1.
```py
x = 5   # Binary: 101
y = 3   # Binary: 011
result = x ^ y  # Binary: 110 (Decimal: 6)
```

**Bitwise NOT (~):**

Performs a bitwise NOT (bitwise complement) operation on an integer.
Inverts all the bits, changing 1s to 0s and vice versa.
```py
x = 5   # Binary: 101
result = ~x   # Binary: -110 (Decimal: -6)
```

**Bitwise Left Shift (<<):**

Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions.
Fills the shifted-in positions with zeros.
```py
x = 5   # Binary: 101
result = x << 2  # Binary: 10100 (Decimal: 20)
```

**Bitwise Right Shift (>>):**

Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions.
Fills the shifted-in positions with zeros for non-negative integers and copies the sign bit for negative integers.
```py
x = 10  # Binary: 1010
result = x >> 1  # Binary: 101 (Decimal: 5)
```

Bitwise operators are useful for various tasks, such as low-level bit manipulation, flag setting and checking, and certain optimization techniques. However, they should be used with care, as they can make code less readable, and their behavior can vary between different Python versions and platforms.


## [Identity Operators](#03---operators)
Identity operators are used to compare the memory addresses of two objects to determine whether they are the same object or not. These operators are useful for checking object identity rather than the equality of their values. Python provides two identity operators: is and is not. 

In Python, is and is not are used to check if two values are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.


![identity](/images/identity%20operators.png)
```py
x1 = 5
y1 = 5
x2 = 'Hello'
y2 = 'Hello'
x3 = [1,2,3]
y3 = [1,2,3]

print(x1 is not y1)  # prints False

print(x2 is y2)  # prints True

print(x3 is y3)  # prints False
```
> **Note: Here, we see that x1 and y1 are integers of the same values, so they are equal as well as identical. Same is the case with x2 and y2 (strings). But x3 and y3 are lists. They are equal but not identical. It is because the interpreter locates them separately in memory although they are equal.**

## [Membership Operators](#03---operators)

Membership operators in Python are used to test whether a specific value or element exists within a sequence, such as a string, list, tuple, or set. Python provides two membership operators: in and not in. These operators return a Boolean value (True or False) based on whether the element is found in the sequence or not.

![membership](/images/Membership-Operators-in-Python.png)

```py
x = 'Hello world'
y = {1:'a', 2:'b'}

# check if 'H' is present in x string
print('H' in x)  # prints True

# check if 'hello' is present in x string
print('hello' not in x)  # prints True

# check if '1' key is present in y
print(1 in y)  # prints True

# check if 'a' key is present in y
print('a' in y)  # prints False
```
**Output:**
```py
True
True
True
False
```
> **Note:Here, 'H' is in x but 'hello' is not present in x (remember, Python is case sensitive). Similarly, 1 is key and 'a' is the value in dictionary y. Hence, 'a' in y returns False.**

## [Operator Precedence and Associativity/Parentheses](#03---operators)

When an expression contains more than one operator, the order of evaluation
depends on the order of operations. For mathematical operators, Python follows
mathematical convention.

**The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:**

* Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression
to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated
first, `2 * (3-1) is 4`, and `(1+1)**(5-2) is 8`.
You can also use parentheses to
make an expression easier to read, as in `(minute * 100) / 60`, even if it doesnâ€™t
change the result.

* Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so `1 + 2**3` is `9`, not `27`, and 
`2*3**2` is `18`, not `36`.

* Multiplication and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction.
So `2*3-1 is 5`, not 4, and `6+4/2 is 8`, not 5.

* So in the expression `degrees/2 * pi`, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2Ï€, you can use parenthesesor write `degrees / 2 / pi`.

![precedence](/images/expression%20precedence.png)

**Operator Precedence in Python**

*  Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except
exponentiation).

|**Precedence**|**Operators**|**Description**|**Associativity**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|1|**()**|Parentheses|Left to right|
|2|**x[index]**,Â **x[index:index]**|Subscription, slicing|Left to right|
|3|await x|Await expression|N/A|
|4|**|Exponentiation|Right to left|
|5|**+x**,Â **-x**,Â **~x**|Positive, negative, bitwise NOT|Right to left|
|6|**\***,Â **@**,Â **/**,Â **//**,Â **%**|Multiplication, matrix, division, floor division, remainder|Left to right|
|7|**+**,Â **â€“**|Addition and subtraction|Left to right|
|8|**<<**,Â **>>**|Shifts|Left to right|
|9|**&**|Bitwise AND|Left to right|
|10|**^**|Bitwise XOR|Left to right|
|11| <b>&#124;</b> |Bitwise OR|Left to right|
|12|**in**,Â **not in**,Â **is**,Â **is not**,Â **<**,Â **<=**,Â **>**,Â **>=**,Â **!=**,Â **==**|Comparisons, membership tests, identity tests|Left to Right|
|13|**not x**|Boolean NOT|Right to left|
|14|**and**|Boolean AND|Left to right|
|15|**or**|Boolean OR|Left to right|
|16|**if-else**|Conditional expression|Right to left|
|17|**lambda**|Lambda expression|N/A|
|18|**:=**|Assignment expression (walrus operator)|Right to left|
