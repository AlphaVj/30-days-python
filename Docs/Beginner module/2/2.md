# [Comments in Python](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
> **Python comments make code easier to understand and they are completely ignored by the interpreter, which means you can provide as many comments as you like in your program to make it more readable and explainatory.**

## [Python supports two types of comments:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
* Single-line comments
* Multi-line comments

### [Single Line Comments in Python:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

In a Python script, the symbol # marks the beginning of comment line. It is effective till the end of line in the editor. If # is the first character of line, then entire line will be assumed as a comment and interpreter will ignore it.

```py
# This is a comment
print ("Hello World")
```

If # is used in the middle of a line, text before it is a valid Python expression, while text following it is treated as comment.
```py
print ("How are you?") # This is also a comment but after a statement.
```
Sometime there is a situation when you don't want a particular line of Python code to be executed, then you can simply comment it as below:
```py
# This is a comment
# print ("How are you?")
print ("Hello World")
```
shortcut key for single line comments:
most of the editors uses schortcuts to comment the lines of code
> VScode and pycharm uses **ctrl + /** to comment and undo comment

### [Multi-line Comment in Python:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

In Python, there is no provision to write multi-line comment, or a block comment. (As in C/C++, where multiple lines inside /* .. */ are treated as multi-line comment).

Each line should have the "#" symbol at the start to be marked as comment in Python and that's how you can create multi-line comments in Python. Many Python IDEs have shortcuts to mark a block of statements as comment.
```py
#
# This is a multi-line comment
#  which can span through multi-line.
#
print ("Hello World")
```

A triple quoted multi-line string is also treated as comment if it is not a docstring of a function or class.
```py
'''
First line in the comment
Second line in the comment
Third line in the comment
'''
print ("Hello World")
```
# [Python Keywords](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler.

We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are. The list of all the keywords is given below.

![reserved words](/images/reserved%20words.png)
# [Variables](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting) 

Variables are fundamental elements in Python and most other programming languages. They are used to store data that can be manipulated, retrieved, and modified during the execution of a program.

Python variables are the reserved memory locations used to store values with in a Python Program. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory. Based on the data type of a variable, Python interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to Python variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.

Data items belonging to different data types are stored in computer's memory. Computer's memory locations are having a number or address, internally represented in binary form. Data is also stored in binary form as the computer works on the principle of binary representation.

 Python's built-in id() function returns the address where the object is stored.

 ```py
 print(id('this is my string lets check where it is in memory location'))
 ```
![id function](/images/id-function.png)

## [Variable Naming Rules:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
The subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning myVar and myvar are considered different variables.
Certain words are reserved and cannot be used as variable names, e.g., if, else, while, etc.
Variable Assignment:

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=).
Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly; it's determined automatically based on the assigned value.

```py
my_variable = 20
name = "vijay"
```
### [Python Variables - Naming Convention](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
It's a good practice to use meaningful variable names to make your code more readable.
For multi-word variable names, you can use snake_case (e.g., my_variable_name) or camelCase (e.g., myVariableName) depending on your preference.

>  * **A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character**
 >  * **A variable name cannot start with a number or any special character like $, (, * % etc.**
 >  * **A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )**
 >  * **Python variable names are case-sensitive which means Name and NAME are two different variables in Python.**
  > * **Python reserved keywords cannot be used naming the variable.**

> **Camel case − First letter is a lowercase, but first letter of each subsequent word is in uppercase. `For example: wordCount, userInput`**

> **Pascal case − First letter of each word is in uppercase. `For example: CheckPrime, TextMessage`**

> **Snake case − Use single underscore (_) character to separate words. `For example: is_num, employee_salary_details, _check`**

> **Macro case - All letters in uppercase and use single underscore (_) character to separate words. `For example: MACRO_CASE, RUN_TIME`**

> **Note: If you want to use the reserved keywords as a variable, use underscore before it. Example: _if, _lambda, _try** 
## [Variable Reassignment:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can change the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it.

```py
x = 5
x = x + 1  # x is now 6
```
**Dynamic Typing:**

Python is dynamically typed, which means you can change the type of a variable by assigning it a value of a different type.

### Constants:

In Python, there are no strict constants like in some other languages, but you can use uppercase variable names to indicate that a variable should not be changed.

```py
PI = 3.14159
```
## [Assigning multiple values to multiple variables](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
```py
a, b, c = 10, 1.414, 'Hello world'

print(a)  # prints 10
print(b)  # prints 1.414
print(c)  # prints Hello world
```
I**f we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once, we can do this as:**

```py
a = b  = 10

print(a)  # prints 10
print(b)  # prints 10
```
## [Deleting Python Variables](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
You can delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement. The syntax of the del statement is −

```py
del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]
```
You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the del statement. For example −

```py
del total
del item1, item2
```
Following examples shows how we can delete a variable and if we try to use a deleted variable then Python interpreter will throw an error:

```total = 100
print(total)

del total
print(total)
```
```
100
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 7, in <module>
    print (total)
NameError: name 'total' is not defined
```
# [Input and Output Statements in Python](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
## [print() function:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

The print() function in Python is used to display output to the console or terminal. It is one of the most commonly used functions for outputting information in Python programs. Here's all you need to know about the print() function:

**Syntax of print()**

syntax of the print function accepts 5 parameters

* object - value(s) to be printed
* sep (optional) - allows us to separate multiple objects inside print().
* end (optional) - allows us to add add specific values like new line "\n", tab "\t"
* file (optional) - where the values are printed. It's default value is sys.stdout (screen)
* flush (optional) - boolean specifying if the output is flushed or buffered. Default: False
### [Basic Usage:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can use print() to display text and values to the console.
```py
print("Hello, World!")
#This will print "Hello, World!" to the console
```

### [Multiple Arguments:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

print() can take multiple arguments separated by commas, and it will print them with spaces by default.
```py
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
#This will print "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
```

### [String Concatenation:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can concatenate strings using + when passing them as arguments to print().
```py
print("Hello, " + "World!")
#This will also print "Hello, World!".
```

### [Separator (sep) and End Character (end):](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can specify the separator (sep) between values and the end character (end) at the end of the printed line using optional keyword arguments.
```py
print("one", "two", "three", sep=", ", end="!\n")
#This will print "one, two, three!" on a single line.
```

### [Formatted Output with f-strings:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Python 3.6 and later versions support f-strings for easy and concise string formatting within print().
```py
name = "Bob"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
#This will print "My name is Bob and I am 25 years old."
```

### [Formatted Output with .format():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can use the .format() method to format output.
```py
name = "Charlie"
age = 35
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
#This produces the same output as the f-string example.
```

> **The print() function is a versatile tool for displaying information and debugging Python programs. It is essential for communicating results, displaying messages, and providing information to users. Proper formatting and use of print() can greatly enhance the readability and usefulness of your code.**

## [input() function:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

The input() function in Python is used for taking input from the user through the console or terminal. It allows you to prompt the user for information and store their input as a string. Here's all you need to know about the input() function:

### [Basic Usage:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

The input() function is called with a prompt (an optional string) to display to the user, and it waits for the user to enter text. The entered text is returned as a string.
```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
#Here, the user is prompted to enter their name, and the input is stored in the name variable.
```


### [User Input as Strings:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

By default, input() returns the user's input as a string. This means that even if the user enters a number, it will be treated as a string.
```py
age = input("Enter your age: ")
```
If you need the input as a different data type (e.g., integer or float), you should explicitly 
cast it using type conversion functions like int() or float().
```py
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

### [Prompting the User:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can include a meaningful prompt in the input() function to instruct the user on what to enter.
```py
city = input("Where do you live? ")
```
A clear prompt helps the user understand what input is expected.

### [Handling Input:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

You can store the input in variables and use it in your program for various purposes, such as calculations or displaying messages.
```py
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
#This program takes the user's name as input and then greets them using their name.
```
The input() function is a valuable tool for creating interactive Python programs that involve user input. It allows you to build programs that can take user-defined data and make decisions or perform actions based on that input.

# [Type Checking and Type Casting in Python](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

## [Type Checking](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Type checking in Python is the process of determining the data type of a variable or an expression. It allows you to verify whether a variable or value is of a particular data type or a subclass of that data type. Python provides several methods for type checking:

### [Using the type() Function:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

The type() function returns the type of an object. You can use it to check the data type of a variable or value.

```py
x = 42
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

#In this example, type(x) returns <class 'int'>, indicating that x is an integer.
```

## [Using the isinstance() Function:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

The isinstance() function checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or type. It can also check if an object is an instance of one of several types.
```py
x = 42
print(isinstance(x, int))  # True

#Here, isinstance(x, int) returns True because x is an instance of the int class.
```
Type checking examples
```py
name = 'vijay'
x = 20
y = 3.14
z = 1 + 4j
is_verified = True
lst_1 = ['vellore', 20, 1.414,False ]
fruits = ('apple','orange','grapes','mango')
set_a = {0,1,2,3,4,5}
dict_1 = {'name':'arun','age':20}

print(type(x)) #output: <class 'int'>
print(type(y)) #output: <class 'float'>
print(type(z)) #output: <class 'complex'>
print(type(is_verified)) #output: <class 'bool'>
print(type(lst_1)) #output: <class 'list'>
print(type(fruits)) #output: <class 'tuple'>
print(type(set_a)) #output: <class 'set'>
print(type(dict_1)) #output: <class 'dict'>
```

## [Type Casting](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of changing the data type of a value or variable in Python. Python provides built-in functions and methods for converting data between different types.

**Common Type Casting Functions:**
### [int():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Converts a value to an integer (int) data type.

**Example:**
```py
x = 5.7
x_as_int = int(x)  # Converts 5.7 to 5 (truncates the decimal part)

x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3
```

### [float():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Converts a value to a floating-point (float) data type.

**Example:**
```py
y = 10
y_as_float = float(y)  # Converts 10 to 10.0

x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2
```

### [str():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Converts a value to a string (str) data type.

**Example:**
```py
num = 42
num_as_str = str(num)  # Converts 42 to "42" (a string)

x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
```

### [bool():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

Converts a value to a boolean (bool) data type. **Common rules:**

Numeric values (e.g., 0, 0.0) become False, while non-zero values become True.
Empty sequences (e.g., empty string, empty list) become False, while non-empty sequences become True.

**Example:**
```py
x = 0
x_as_bool = bool(x)  # Converts 0 to False
```

### [list():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
list() function is used to convert a values to list data type

```py
# Using the list() constructor to create a list
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_list = list(my_tuple)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]

# Converting a string into a list of characters
my_string = "Hello"
char_list = list(my_string)
print(char_list)  # Output: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

my_string = "Hello"
string_list = [my_string]
print(string_list)# output: ['Hello']

# Converting a Dictionary into a list
my_dict =  {'name':'vijay', 'age':20}
list_keys = list(my_dict)# here only keys are converted
print(list_keys) # output:['name', 'age']
list_values = list(my_dict.values())# only values are converted
print(list_values)
```
### [tuple():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
tuple() function is used to convert a values to tuple.
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)  # Converts list to tuple

my_string = "Hello"
char_tuple = tuple(my_string)
```
### [set():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
**Creating an Empty Set:**
You can use set() with no arguments to create an empty set.

```py
empty_set = set()
```
**Converting a List or Iterable to a Set:**

You can use set() to convert a list or any other iterable into a set. The resulting set will contain only unique elements, removing any duplicates.
```py
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
my_set = set(my_list)# output: {1,2,3,4,5}
# set must always contains a unique elements only so, while converting my_list contains duplicate values, set() will removes the duplicates
```
Creating a Set from a String:
You can use set() to create a set of characters from a string.

```py
my_string = "hello"
char_set = set(my_string)
```
### [dict():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
 you can use the dict() constructor to cast or convert various iterable objects or sequences into dictionaries. This process typically involves converting pairs of elements into key-value pairs in the resulting dictionary. 

**List of Tuples to Dictionary:**

You can convert a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair, into a dictionary.
```py
kv_list = [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
my_dict = dict(kv_list)
#This will create a dictionary with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' and their corresponding values.
```

**List of Lists to Dictionary:**

You can convert a list of lists where each inner list has exactly two elements (key and value) into a dictionary.

```py
kv_list = [['name', 'Alice'], ['age', 30], ['city', 'New York']]
my_dict = dict(kv_list)

#This will produce the same result as in the previous example, creating a dictionary with keys 'name', 'age', and 'city' and their corresponding values.
```

**List of Two Separate Lists to Dictionary:**

You can convert two separate lists, one containing keys and the other containing values, into a dictionary using the zip() function.

```py
keys = ['name', 'age', 'city']
values = ['Bob', 25, 'Los Angeles']
my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))

#This code creates a dictionary with keys 'name', 'age', and 'city' and their corresponding values.
```

**List of Strings to Dictionary:**

If you have a list of strings, you can convert it into a dictionary where each string becomes a key, and the corresponding values are set to None.

```py
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
my_dict = dict.fromkeys(my_list)

#This will create a dictionary with keys 'apple', 'banana', and 'cherry', with values set to None.
```


**Tuple of Key-Value Pairs to Dictionary:**

You can also convert a tuple of key-value pairs into a dictionary.

```py
kv_tuple = (('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3))
my_dict = dict(kv_tuple)

#This will create a dictionary with keys 'a', 'b', and 'c' and their corresponding values.
```

### [ord() and chr():](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)

* ord() converts a character to its Unicode code point (integer) - ASCII.
* chr() converts a Unicode code point (integer) to its corresponding character.

**Example:**

```py
char = 'A'
code_point = ord(char)  # Converts 'A' to 65 (its Unicode code point)
```
```py
Ascii = 67
char = chr(Ascii)# converts Ascii value of 67 to character 'C'
print(char) #prints 'C'
```
> **ASCII value for capital Alphabets 'A' - 'Z' start from 65 to 90**
> **ASCII value for small letter alphabets 'a' to 'z' is 97 to 122
### [Implicit Type Casting (Coercion):](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
Python also performs implicit type casting in certain situations, especially when performing operations between different data types. 

**For example:**

```py
x = 5
y = 2.5
result = x + y  # Implicitly converts x to a float before addition
```

In this case, x is implicitly converted to a float to perform the addition operation with y. This is known as type coercion.

### [Handling Type Errors:](#02---comments-reserved-kewords-variables-type-checking-and-type-casting)
It's important to note that not all type conversions are valid or meaningful. Attempting to convert data to an incompatible type may result in a TypeError.

 For example:

```py
text = "Hello"
num = int(text)  # Raises a TypeError since 
```
"Hello" cannot be converted to an integer

```py
Python 3.12.0 (tags/v3.12.0:0fb18b0, Oct  2 2023, 13:03:39) [MSC v.1935 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> a = int("10.5")
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10.5'

>>> a = int("Hello World")
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Hello World'
```
Type casting is a crucial aspect of Python programming, as it allows you to work with different data types and perform operations on them as needed. Proper type casting ensures that your code operates correctly and safely.
