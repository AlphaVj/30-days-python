# [Introduction](#awesome-python-course-beginners-to-advance) 
> Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Although it is a general-purpose language, it is used in various areas of applications such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, web development, IoT, and more.

This Awesome Python Course has been written for the beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts of Python Programming Language. After completing this course you will find yourself to be more confidence and experience in python. 

# [What is Python?](#awesome-python-course-beginners-to-advance)
Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
* **High-level:** Python is considered a high-level programming language because it abstracts many low-level details, such as memory management and hardware-specific operations, away from the programmer. This abstraction allows developers to focus more on solving problems and writing code that is easier to read and maintain. High-level languages are designed to be user-friendly and provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying hardware.

* **General-Purpose:** Python is a general-purpose language, which means it is not specialized for a specific type of application or domain. It can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from web development and data analysis to scientific computing, artificial intelligence, scripting, and more. Python's versatility and extensive libraries make it suitable for a broad range of applications.

> Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including Procedural, Object Oriented and Functional programming language. Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

# Why to Learn Python?
Python is a popular programming language for several compelling reasons, making it a preferred choice for a wide range of applications. Here are some of the key reasons why Python is a great language to learn and use:

**1) Readability and Simplicity:** Python's syntax is designed to be clean and readable, with a focus on human-friendly code. Its use of indentation for block structure forces clean and consistent code formatting, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain code.

**2) Versatility:** Python is a general-purpose programming language, meaning it can be used for almost any type of application or project. Whether you're interested in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, or game development, Python has libraries and frameworks to support your needs.

**3) Large Standard Library:** Python comes with an extensive standard library that includes modules and functions for common tasks, reducing the need to write code from scratch. This library simplifies various aspects of development, such as file handling, networking, and data manipulation.

**4) Community and Documentation:** Python has a vast and active community of developers worldwide. This community contributes to the language's growth, provides extensive documentation, and offers support through forums, mailing lists, and online resources. This makes it easy to find solutions to common problems and learn from others.

**5) Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python is available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like systems. Code written in Python is highly portable, allowing developers to create applications that work seamlessly across different operating systems.

**6) Interpreted Language:** Python is an interpreted language, meaning you can write and execute code directly without the need for compilation. This results in quicker development cycles and easier debugging.

**7) Dynamic Typing:** Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. This dynamic typing makes the language flexible and allows for rapid prototyping and development.

**8) Open Source:** Python is open source and freely available, encouraging collaboration and innovation. Developers can contribute to the language's development, and this openness has led to the creation of numerous third-party libraries and frameworks.

**9) Data Science and Machine Learning:** Python is a dominant language in the fields of data science and machine learning. Libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow have made it the go-to language for data analysis and artificial intelligence projects.

**10) Web Development:** Python offers powerful web development frameworks like Django and Flask, making it easy to build robust and scalable web applications.

**11) Automation and Scripting:** Python is often used for automation and scripting tasks due to its simplicity and ease of use. It's widely employed for tasks like data scraping, file manipulation, and system administration.

**12) Job Opportunities:** Python is in high demand in the job market. Learning Python can open up career opportunities in various industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and more.

# Pythonic Code Style
Python leaves you free to choose to program in an object-oriented, procedural, functional, aspect-oriented, or even logic-oriented way. These freedoms make Python a great language to write clean and beautiful code.

**Pythonic Code Style is actually more of a design philosophy and suggests to write a code which is :**

* Clean
* Simple
* Beautiful
* Explicit
* Readable

> When Comes into Program Execution, the Program Transulator, which converts the high-level(Program code) to Low Level(Machine Understandable code 0's and 1's) are Categorized as:
* Compiler
* Interpreter
* Assembler

# Compiler
> A compiler translates the entire source code written by a programmer into machine code or an intermediate code in a single step. This translation is done before execution. The resulting executable file can be run multiple times without needing to recompile, as the translation is already complete.

> Compiled code is often platform-dependent. A program compiled for one architecture or operating system may not run on another without recompilation for the target platform.

> **Compiler:** Languages like C, C++, Rust, and Go are typically compiled languages.

# What is Interpreter ?
 > A python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out into code that the computer can understand. 

 > An interpreter translates the source code line by line or statement by statement, executing each line immediately after translation. There is no separate compilation step, and the translation and execution are interleaved.

 > Interpreted languages are often more portable because the interpreter can be installed on various platforms, allowing the same source code to run on different systems without modification.

> **Interpreter:** Languages like Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP are typically interpreted languages.
# Environment Setup
Python Interpreter is readily available for all leading Platforms (i.e Windows, ubuntu, MAC, unix, Palm Os, etc..)

To Run a Python Scripts first you need to Download and Install the Python Software and Other Editors.



## Installing Python on Windows

**Step 1: Download the Full Installer**

First you need to Download Python, Download the Latest Version in: https://www.python.org/downloads/

![Python Download](./images/python%20download.png)

**Step 2: Run the Installer**
next, run it by double-clicking on the downloaded file.
* Tick the check box Add python.exe to PATH
* Then, Click on Install Now
* After Installing, Restart the Windows

![installation Dialogue Box](./images/python-setup.png)

**Step 3: Verify Python Was Installed On Windows**
* open your command prompt and type `python --version` or type `python` to see the python interactive mode in command prompt.

**Step 4: Upgrade the Pip**
 Type this command `pip install --upgrade pip` to upgrade the pip
## Python Shell

Python's standard library has an executable module called IDLE – short for Integrated Development and Learning Environment. Find it from Window start menu and launch.

python has two basic modes which are interactive mode and script mode

#### Interactive Mode:
The Python interactive shell is opened and it is waiting for you to write Python code(Python script). You will write your Python script next to this symbol >>> and then click Enter then it shows result in next line.

Let us do some maths first before we write any Python code:

- 5 + 2 is 7
- 4/2 is 2.0
- 5 ** 3 is same as 5 * 5 * 5
- 4 % 2 = 0 => `%` used to get remainder value of division
- 4 // 2 = 2 => returns the integer part of division quotient

![interactive mode](./images/idle-interactive.png)

#### Script Mode
For script mode you will need to open a new file in File menu,a new python file will opened then type your python code and save it,afer that click 'run module' in run menu or simply press `F5` to Run the code, the output will shown on the idle shell.

![](./images/idle-script1.png)
![](./images/idle-script2.png)

## Python in windows command prompt
On your PC press windows key + R, a run pannel will appear in that type cmd and press enter,
the command prompt will open,
*  then type `python --version` and press enter to see the downloaded version of python in your system.
* similarly use the command `pip -V` to view the version and system installed location of pip. Later on in this course we will see about pip.
* use the command `python` to run the python interactive mode in command prompt.

![](./images/python%20in%20cmd.png)

**create a python script file in notepad and Run it in command prompt:**
   * open the notepad
   * type your python scripts
   * go to file menu click save as,
   * choose the location then type the file name ending with `.py`  and also change the save_as_type to `All Files`
   * now your python script file is ready

Run the python script file in command prompt, by using this command `python your_file_name` 

**for example:**
```
python hello.py
```
 the above command will works only if your python script file present on the same current working directory of command prompt

if your python script file is in another disk/directory, use the command `python your_fie_location`.From the previous command instead of file name you should mention your file name along with the file path/location or else change the current working directory(CWD) to the directory where your python script file is located using system commands: `dir`- to list the directories and files in CWD, `cd ..` - move back to parent directory, `cd /d path` - to change the CWD to another specified path

for example:
 ```
 D:\> cd /d C:\Users\vijay\Downloads
 D:\> python C:\Users\vijay\Downloads\hello.py
 ```


## Installing Python on Ubuntu

**Check If Python is Already Installed on Ubuntu:**
1. First, open Terminal using the “Alt + Ctrl + T” keyboard shortcut and run the below command. If the command gives an output with the version number, it means you already have Python installed in Ubuntu. To exit Python’s environment, press “Ctrl + D”. In case you get an error message like “Command not found”, you don’t have Python installed. So move to the next method to install it.
```shell
python3
```
![install](./images/python-ubuntu1.jpg)

2. You can also run the below command to check the Python version on your Ubuntu installation.
```shell
python3 --version
```
3. If an older version of Python is installed, run the below command to update Python to the latest version on your Linux distro.
```shell
sudo apt --only-upgrade install python3
```
![upgrade](./images/python-ubuntu2.jpg)

### Install Python in Ubuntu from Official Repository
Python is available in Ubuntu’s official repository, so you don’t have to do much other than execute a simple command to seamlessly install it on your system. Here is how to do it.

1. Open Terminal in Ubuntu and run the below command to update all the packages and repositories.
```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
![install](./images/python-ubunt3.jpg)

2. Next, install Python in Ubuntu by running the below command. This will automatically install Python on your machine.
```shell
sudo apt install python3
```
![install](./images/python-ubuntu4.jpg)

* Use the terminal command `python3` to open a python interactive mode 

**create a python script file in text editor and Run it in Terminal:**
   * open the text editor
   * type your python scripts
   * choose the location then save your file with the name ending with `.py`  and also change.
   * now your python script file is ready

Run the python script file in Terminal, by using this command `python3 your_file_name` 

**for example:**
```
python3 hello.py
```
 the above command will works only if your python script file present on the same Present working directory(PWD)

if your python script file is in another disk/directory, use the command `python3 your_fie_location`. From the previous command instead of file name you should mention your file name along with the file path/location or else change the PWD to the directory where your python script file is located using system commands: `ls`- to list the directories and files in PWD, `cd ..` - move back to parent directory, `cd /` - change the directory to root directory, `cd path` - to change the PWD to another specified path

**for example:**
 ```
 lenovo:~$ cd /home/username/Downloads
 lenovo:~$ python3 /home/username/Downloads/hello.py
 ```
 ## Working with code Editors:

 ### Install and Setup VScode Editor:

 **How to Setup VScode For Python:**

# Virtual Environment
In Python, a virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a specific version of the Python interpreter and a set of packages and libraries. Virtual environments are used to isolate Python projects from one another, ensuring that each project has its own dependencies without interfering with the system-wide Python installation. This is particularly useful when working on multiple projects with different package requirements or when you need to manage dependencies for a project.

let us understand by a Scenario,

**Scenario:** Developing Multiple Web Applications with Different Django Versions

Imagine you are a web developer working on two separate web applications, both built using the Django web framework. However, each of these applications requires a different version of Django due to specific compatibility and feature requirements.

**Project A:** This is a web application that relies on Django 2.1. It was started a couple of years ago, and upgrading to a newer Django version would require extensive code changes and testing.

**Project B:** This is a new project you're working on, and you want to use the latest version of Django (let's say Django 4.0) to take advantage of its new features and improvements.

In this scenario, using Python virtual environments is essential

## Why to Use Virtual Environments?

1. **Isolation:** Virtual environments allow you to isolate project-specific dependencies from the system-wide Python installation, preventing conflicts.

2. **Dependency Management:** You can manage the packages and libraries required for a particular project separately from others.

3. **Version Control:** Virtual environments enable you to specify the exact version of Python and packages for your project, making it easier to reproduce the environment on different machines.

## Creating a Virtual Environment:
You can create a virtual environment using the built-in venv module (available in Python 3.3 and later) or by using third-party tools like virtualenv.

**Step 1: Open a command prompt or Vscode Terminal.**

**Step 2: Set the cmd Path to your Project Folder using `cd /d path` command.**

**Step 3: Type the command `pip install virtualenv` and enter it, wait for the vnev package to install.**

**Step 4: Enter the below command to create a Virtual Environment.**

Here, myvenv is the folder in which a new Python virtual environment will be created 

```py
python -m venv myenv
```
![create](./images/VE1.png)

Also you can create the Virtual Environment using
```py
virtualenv myenv
```
![create](./images/VE2.png)
the created myenv folder contains the following utilities
![folder](./images/VE%20files.png)

## Activating a Virtual Environment:
To activate a virtual environment, you use the appropriate command based on your operating system:

To enable this new virtual environment, execute activate.bat in Scripts folder.

![script](./images/VE-script.png)

**On Windows:**
```py
myenv\Scripts\activate
```
![cmd](./images/VE3.png)
**On macOS and Linux:**
```py
source myenv/bin/activate
```
After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate the active virtual environment.

### Installing Packages:
With your virtual environment active, you can use pip to install packages specific to your project. **For example:**

```py
 pip install package_name
```
## Deactivating a Virtual Environment:
To deactivate a virtual environment and return to the system-wide Python installation, you can simply type:

```py
deactivate
```
![deactivate](./images/VE4.png)

### Managing Environment Dependencies:
You can list all installed packages and their versions in your virtual environment using:

```py
pip list
```
You can also export the list of dependencies to a text file for easy sharing and environment replication:

To start with project, it would be better to have a virtual environment. Virtual environment can help us to create an isolated or separate environment. This will help us to avoid conflicts in dependencies across projects. If you write pip freeze on your terminal you will see all the installed packages on your computer. If we use virtualenv, we will access only packages which are specific for that project.

```py
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
**To install dependencies from a requirements file in a new virtual environment, you can use:**

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* **Using Virtual Environments with IDEs:**
Most integrated development environments (IDEs) have built-in support for virtual environments. You can configure your IDE to use the virtual environment for your project, making it seamless to work with.

* **Cleaning Up:**
To remove a virtual environment, simply delete its directory. Be cautious when doing this, as it will permanently delete all the packages and libraries installed within that environment.

# Python Syntax
The Python syntax defines a set of rules that are used to create a Python Program. The Python Programming Language Syntax has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java Programming Languages. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.

Python is a Case sensitive Language so, all the Syntax athere to it. Because of the way it handles identifiers, such as variable names, function names, and class names. Case sensitivity means that Python treats uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct characters. 

# Python Indentation
In Python, indentation is a fundamental aspect of the language's syntax and plays a crucial role in structuring your code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other symbols to define code blocks, Python uses whitespace indentation to indicate the hierarchy and scope of code.

**Whitespace Indentation:** Python uses spaces or tabs (whitespace) to define code blocks and nest statements within those blocks. Indentation is typically done using spaces, and the recommended standard is to use four spaces for each level of indentation. Mixing tabs and spaces is generally discouraged to maintain code consistency.

**Blocks and Statements:** Python uses indentation to group statements into blocks of code. Blocks are created within functions, loops, conditionals, and other control structures. All statements within the same block must have the same level of indentation.

**Indentation Levels:** To define nested blocks, you increase the level of indentation by adding more spaces (or tabs) to the left of the code. To end a block, you decrease the indentation level. This visual structure helps make the code more readable.
 
> **Note:  One of the common bugs when writing a python code is applying a wrong indentations.**

Don't Worry about this we will see how the syntax and indentations are used, in all other topics.

# Data Types in Python

Data type represents a kind of value and determines what operations can be done on it. Numeric, non-numeric and Boolean (true/false) data are the most obvious data types. However, each programming language has its own classification largely reflecting its programming philosophy.

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined at runtime, and you don't need to declare the type explicitly. Python has several built-in data types that cover a wide range of use cases.

Python has various built-in data types :
* Numeric - int, float, complex
* String - str
* Sequence - list, tuple, range
* Binary - bytes, bytearray, memoryview
* Mapping - dict
* Boolean - bool
* Set - set, frozenset
* None - NoneType

## Number
* **Integer:**

      Any representation involving only the digit symbols (0 to 9) creates an object of int type. The object so declared may be referred by a variable using an assignment operator.

      Integer(negative, zero and positive) numbers Example: ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ...

* **Float:**

      A floating point number consists of an integral part and a fractional part. Conventionally, a decimal point symbol (.) separates these two parts in a literal representation of a float.

      Decimal number Example ... -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.5 ...

* **Complex Numbers:**

      A complex number comprises of a real and imaginary component. The imaginary component is any number (integer or floating point) multiplied by square root of "-1"

      Example 2 + 4j, -1 + 2j

* **Booleans**

      A boolean data type is consist of two values, that is 
      * True
      * False 
      the starting letter T and F should be always uppercase.

      > **In Python, the boolean data type represents two values: True and False. Booleans are often used for making logical decisions and controlling the flow of a program through conditional statements like if, else, and while. They are fundamental for expressing and evaluating logical expressions.**



  
## Python Sequence Data Type

> Python sequences are bounded and iterable - Whenever we say an iterable in Python, it means a sequence data type (for example, a list).

**String**
   A collection of one or more characters under a single or double quote. If a string is more than one sentence then we use a triple quote.

   A string object is one of the sequence data types in Python. It is an immutable sequence of Unicode code points. Code point is a number corresponding to a character according to Unicode standard. Strings are objects of Python's built-in class 'str'.

   String literals are written by enclosing a sequence of characters in single quotes ('hello'), double quotes ("hello") or triple quotes ('''hello''' or """hello""").
Example:

```py
' Awesome Python Course '
" This is a Beginner's module"
''' I hope you are getting lots of Python 
knowledge and coding experience 
after the completion of this Course '''
```
**List**

   List object in Python is a collection of objects of other data type. List is an ordered collection of items not necessarily of same type. Individual object in the collection is accessed by index starting with zero.

   Literal representation of a list object is done with one or more items which are separated by comma and enclosed in square brackets [].


Examples:
```py
[20,'vijay',3.11,True,2+4j]
['mon','tue','wed','thu','fri']
[1,2,3,4,5]
[True,False,False,True]
```

**Tuple**

Tuple object in Python is a collection of objects of other data type. Tuple is an ordered collection of items not necessarily of same type. Individual object in the collection is accessed by index starting with zero.

Literal representation of a tuple object is done with one or more items which are separated by comma and enclosed in parentheses ().

Examples:

```py
('apple','orange','banana')
(1,2,3,4,5)
```
**Set**

   Set is a Python implementation of set as defined in Mathematics. A set in Python is a collection, but is not an indexed or ordered collection as string, list or tuple. An object cannot appear more than once in a set, whereas in List and Tuple, same object can appear more than once.

   Comma separated items in a set are put inside curly brackets or braces {}. Items in the set collection can be of different data types.
```py
{2023, "Python", 3.11, 5+6j, 1.23E-4}
{(5+6j), 3.11, 0.000123, 'Python', 2023}
```
**Dictionary**

   Python dictionaries are kind of hash table type. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

   Python dictionary is like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key:value pairs. The pairs are separated by comma and put inside curly brackets {}. To establish mapping between key and value, the semicolon':' symbol is put between the two.

```py
{'name': 'vijay','age':20, 'dept': 'CSE'}
```
